Hi! I’m Anton. This is my personal corner — notes on game dev, tools, processes, and life.  

## Why this blog
First and foremost, it’s for myself: to capture what I did and why, so I can easily revisit decisions later — and look back with some healthy retrospection. Most posts will be about Unity development, but it won’t be limited to that; there are plenty of interesting things outside of gamedev I might want to write about from time to time.

## My guiding principles
- **Measure before you tweak.** Understand, then optimize.  
- **Less friction.** Tools should speed you up, not break your flow.  
- **Keep it simple.** Today it’s a feature, tomorrow it’s maintenance.  
- **People over tooling.** Processes should adapt to the team, not the other way around.
